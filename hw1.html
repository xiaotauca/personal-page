<p>My name is Ting Xiao. I am a student from Software Engineering department in AUCA. I am from China, and this is my second university. My first university was in China, 5 years ago. My first major in China was Financial accounting. But after my first graduation, I did not work as accountant. I ever worked as advertisement manager in a game company, and I also worked as a trader in one cryptocurrenty company. During my second experience, I found my interest in blockchain technology, and I realized my lack of knowledge in coding. So I decided to pursue my second major in programming. At the same time, my fiance came to Kyrgyzstan, so I applied for AUCA, the best university in central asia.</p>
